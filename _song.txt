I took a walk around the world to ease my troubled mind
I left my body laying somewhere in the sands of time
I watched the world float to the dark side of the moon
I feel there is nothing I can do, yeah

I watched the world float to the dark side of the moon
After all I knew it had to be something to do with you
I really don't mind what happens now and then
As long as you'll be my friend at the end

If I go crazy then will you still call me Superman
If I'm alive and well,
Will you be there holding my hand
I'll keep you by my side with my superhuman might
Kryptonite

You called me strong, you called me weak but your secrets I will keep
You took for granted all the times I never let you down
You stumbled in and bumped your head, if
Not for me then you would be dead I picked you up and put you back on solid ground
